README Seymour!! Here is my README file for Project 0 for CS162 Spring 2024 course at LBCC.

5 topics that I find interesting in relation to computers:

-I am very interested in AI and try to stay on the frontend of any new AI developments. I love how it can help with productivity/efficiency in workflows and the new creativity opportunities it provides.
-I am interested in coding microcontrollers such as the Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico. I have some experience in both. I find interfacing electronics and programming them very interesting. 
-I am interested in application development. I have a few ideas of different applications that I think would be useful.
-I am interested in game design. I have a few game ideas. I also have few ideas for rendering graphics in a different way, whether it would be beneficial I do not know, but it would be fun to experiment with.
-Another topic that is somewhat related to computers that I find interesting, is the use of analog and physical interfacing with computers. I think with the progression and advancements of technology and AI, people (including myself) are actually going to want to start reverting back to more "analog" and "retro" style of interacting with technology. (Example: Modern tech has been constantly pushing towards less and less physical buttons and more touchscreens or even virtual buttons(VR and AR) but I think people are going to want tech to be more physically interactive like in the past.) 

5 topics that I think will be challenging in relation to computers:

-I think it will be a little bit of a challenge jumping back into coding. I have not taken CS 161 for around 2 years so I am a little rusty.
-Another thing that might be a challenge is that when I took CS 161, it was in C++, so transferring over to Python will be a shift(however I am not too worried since I do have some prior experience with Python and its a pretty forgiving language)
-I am a hands on learner and thrive with being able to physically interact with what I am working on, which is tough to do with coding unless its programming something like a microcontroller. This could potentially pose challenges.
-I am somehwat of a slow typer and rely heavily on the search and poke method, so I think it will be good for me to learn some of the useful keybinds to help speed up my efficency.
-I know pointers has been a area of confusion for me in the past and still is confusing. Mainly because I dont really understand the full purpose of them.
